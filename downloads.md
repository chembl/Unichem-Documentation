# Downloads

 Downloads of UniChem data sets are available on [the FTP site](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/)

 The top level of the FTP site is divided into two subdirectories: ' [KNIME](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/KNIME)', containing KNIME protocols used to query UniChem, and ' [data](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/data) ', containing UniChem data downloads.

 The 'data' directory is divided into two sudbirectories: ' [oracleDumps](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/data/oracleDumps) ', which contains oracle dump files of UniChem, and txt files of selected tables, and ' [wholeSourceMapping](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/UniChem/data/wholeSourceMapping) ' which contains mappings of src\_compound\_ids between different sources.

 README files at each directory level give more information.
